# Silo Operations Analysis PoC

This is a Proof of Concept (PoC) project that demonstrates the use of LangChain and Google's Gemini AI model for analyzing silo operations data. The system uses Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to provide context-aware analysis of silo operations, identifying patterns, anomalies, and generating actionable insights.

## Features

- ü§ñ Powered by Google's Gemini 2.0 Flash model
- üîç Context-aware analysis using RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)
- üîÑ Vector-based semantic search using Pinecone and Xenova transformers
- üìä Structured insights generation including:
  - Anomaly detection with severity levels
  - Trend identification
  - Actionable recommendations
- üåê REST API endpoints for data analysis
- üìÑ HTML report generation with beautiful, responsive design
- üìù Support for both sample data and custom data input

## Technical Stack

- Node.js/TypeScript
- LangChain
- Google Generative AI (Gemini)
- Express.js
- Zod for data validation
- Pinecone Vector Database
- Xenova Transformers (all-MiniLM-L6-v2 model)

## Vector Store Implementation

The project uses a custom vector store implementation that:

- Utilizes Pinecone for vector similarity search
- Employs Xenova's all-MiniLM-L6-v2 model for embeddings
- Implements document chunking with overlap for better context
- Provides semantic search capabilities for relevant context retrieval
- Handles metadata sanitization and storage

```

## Setup

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Create a `.env` file with required environment variables:
   ```
   PORT=3000
   GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_api_key
   PINECONE_API_KEY=your_pinecone_api_key
   ```
4. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run server:dev
   ```

## Development

This is a PoC project demonstrating the integration of LangChain with Google's Gemini model for industrial data analysis. The system is designed to be extensible and can be adapted for various industrial monitoring and analysis use cases.

The vector store implementation provides semantic search capabilities that enhance the context retrieval process, making the analysis more accurate and relevant. The system uses document chunking and embedding to efficiently store and retrieve relevant context from historical data.

## Note

This is a Proof of Concept and should not be used in production without proper testing and security measures.
